abstract: |
  Modeling of the soil-structure interface has been a critical issue in geotechnical engineering. Numerous studies have been reported to simulate complex soil-structure interface behaviors. Assessment of these models is usually carried out by direct comparisons between the simulations and experiments. However, little work has been done to compare the specific interface behaviors simulated by different interface models. This paper aims to evaluate some frequently recognized interface behaviors for six different interface models. These models are either adopted from the existing literature or modified from the existing soil models, including the Exponential model, Hyperbolic model, Hypoplastic model, MCC model, SANISAND model, and SIMSAND model. Global comparisons and effects of the soil density, normal stiffness, and shearing rate are investigated to evaluate the interface models based on the Fontainebleau sand-steel interface experiments and the Kaolin clay-steel interface experiments. Discussions have been made on the limitations and advantages of different models under different conditions.
