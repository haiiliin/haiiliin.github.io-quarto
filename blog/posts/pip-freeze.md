# Freezing Installed Python Packages

Use the `pip freeze` command to generate a list of installed packages and their versions and save it to the
`requirements.txt` file.

```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file can be used to install the same packages and versions on another machine.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
